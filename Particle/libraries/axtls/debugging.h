/**
 * Demonstrate the use of the axTLS library in C with a set of 
 * command-line parameters similar to openssl. In fact, openssl clients 
 * should be able to communicate with axTLS servers and visa-versa.
 *
 * This code has various bits enabled depending on the configuration. To enable
 * the most interesting version, compile with the 'full mode' enabled.
 *
 * To see what options you have, run the following:
 * > axssl s_server -?
 * > axssl s_client -?
 *
 * The axtls shared library must be in the same directory or be found 
 * by the OS.
