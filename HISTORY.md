TODO:
(1) Assemble the irrigation system
(2) Integrate the 50W solar panel
(3) Establish I2C communication between a Photon, RedBoard/XBee and 
    a Beagle Bone Black Wireless or Raspberry Pi 3 (or both!)
(4) Establish I2C communication between the Mega 2560 and the RedBoard/XBee
(5) Begin coding
(6) Harden wiring from breadboards to proto boards

Struggling with the Beagle Bone Black computers.  I updated the flash on two BBB wireless boards.  One
seems to work ok and the other, the wireless does not initialize.  I am about to throw this lot into
the junk heap and work with a Raspberry Pi 3.  I will reflash the BBBWs one more time and being careful.

It also seems like the BBBW want to act as access points.  I really want to be able to reboot them on
demand and have them connect to the established wireless connection at home.  The one that is working
is only sporadically working to allow ssh connections over the wifi.   Very disappointing.

The SHT10 sensor is also tested and ready to go.
