Struggling with the Beagle Bone Black computers.  I updated the flash on two BBB wireless boards.  One
seems to work ok and the other, the wireless does not initialize.  I am about to throw this lot into
the junk heap and work with a Raspberry Pi 3.  I will reflash the BBBWs one more time and being careful.

It also seems like the BBBW want to act as access points.  I really want to be able to reboot them on
demand and have them connect to the established wireless connection at home.  The one that is working
is only sporadically working to allow ssh connections over the wifi.   Very disappointing.

The SHT10 sensor is also tested and ready to go.
