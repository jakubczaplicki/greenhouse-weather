# Greenhouse/Weather
A greenhouse / weather station project (off grid) intermixed with MQTT and Node-Red.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/jr3cermak/greenhouse-weather/wiki) page for details on this project.

*This is a work in progress.*  This will end up very customized.  Hopefully, you can utilize many of
the details here to bring your project to life.   If you have a question, feel free to ask it by filing
an [issue](https://github.com/jr3cermak/greenhouse-weather/issues) in this repository.

For more of a larger scale project, I refer you to this
[Github](https://github.com/OpenAgInitiative/openag_pfc2) repository.

There is a desire to make a 
[Minimum Viable Product](https://community.particle.io/t/designing-a-multifuction-greenhouse-controller/30912/18?u=cermak)
version.  If you would like to help, follow the link and ask Peter.   I have it bookmarked just to monitor at
the moment.
